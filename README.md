# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies
## Overview of the project
The purpose of this project was to create an unsupervised machine learning model for a Cryptocurrencies dataset. One of the main goals was to create a classification for this cryptocurrencies, based on a K-Means Algorithm model. 

The following tools were used in this project:
1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. The Pandas Library (data preprocessing)
4. The Scikit-Learn Library (for the model)
5. The HvPlot and Plotly Libraries (for data visualization)

You can find all the code in the "challenge_code" folder.
